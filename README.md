# Angular2-and-Node-Fileupload


Client : Angular2 (localhost: 4200)
Server: Node (localhost:3000)

applied gulp to run the server.

How to run:
1. clone this git
2. run npm install for both anuglar and node
3. ng serve --open for angular and gulp for node

later: 
- Add MonogoDB to save file data uploaded
- need to solve why I get error from response after uploading files, although files are stored at the node server....

This, below, is where I refer to build this application.
